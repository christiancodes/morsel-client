# Morsel - Kitchen Thoughts

Record your thoughts and writings while you're in the kitchen. Designed for use on a dedicated Raspberry Pi terminal on your kitchen counter. Connects to a [m3lon](https://www.m3lon.com) pantry.

To connect to your pantry, check your pantry's Settings page for your Morsel Code and make it an environment variable on your terminal: `export MORSEL_CODE=your-unique-code`
